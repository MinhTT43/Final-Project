                                Reduced vision can reduce mobility by making it
                                more difficult to move through the environment
                                safely, efficiently and independently.

                            Our Object Tracking technology can enhance object
                            detection for many people with reduced vision which
                            increases mobility. Our technology can identify and
                            track both stationary and moving objects. Obstacles
                            are also detected and marked. Users can feel safer
                            and move more freely with enhanced AR vision powered
                            by Horizon!

                            Horizon Real Time Object Tracking with AR glasses
                            detects targets, marks them by a "boundary box" and
                            other visual aids, and tracks them, in real time.
                            This increases environmental targets awareness
                            greatly for users with reduced vision, improving
                            mobility.
